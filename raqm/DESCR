Raqm is a small library that encapsulates the logic for complex text
layout and provides a convenient API.

It currently provides bidirectional text support (using FriBiDi),
shaping (using HarfBuzz), and proper script itemization. As a result,
Raqm can support most writing systems covered by Unicode.

The documentation can be accessed on the web at:
http://host-oman.github.io/libraqm/

Raqm is writing, also number or digit and the Arabic word for digital
shares the same root, so it is a play on "digital writing".
